Developed a supervised machine learning model to detect fraudulent UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions.

Imported and preprocessed a dataset including features such as transaction type, payment gateway, transaction state, merchant category, etc.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to identify patterns and correlations related to fraud.

Applied feature engineering techniques including:

---Handling missing values
---Encoding categorical variables with one-hot encoding
---Normalizing or scaling numerical features

Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models including:

--Decision Tree Classifier
--Random Forest Classifier
--Gradient Boosting Classifier
--XGBoost Classifier

Used evaluation metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC Score to compare model performance.

Visualized model performance using bar plots and confusion matrices.

Saved the best-performing model using pickle for deployment.

Deployed the model through a Flask web application for real-time fraud prediction.
